solana-governance-policy-engine

A standards-driven rules engine for Solana DAOs and programs, enabling governance policies to be defined, versioned, and enforced as code.

Vision

This project treats governance as a first-class, machine-readable artifact. Policies are defined in a structured schema, validated by a CLI, and enforced by on-chain and off-chain components. The goal is to make governance:

- Explicit: Policies live in versioned config, not tribal knowledge.
- Auditable: Changes are tracked, diffed, and reviewable.
- Composable: The same policy model can be reused across DAOs and programs.
- Enforceable: Policies are wired into program logic and operational workflows.

Architecture.md

- Quantum layer: Governance policy model and metadata standard.
- Nano layer: Small, focused policy evaluation primitives and helpers.
- Micro layer: The policy engine, CLI, and integration patterns that compose nano modules and implement quantum standards.

Components

- POLICY_SCHEMA.json  
  Canonical JSON schema for governance policies (treasury, voting, roles, thresholds, etc.).

- engine/  
  Rust library for evaluating policies and integrating them into Solana programs.

- cli/  
  Command-line tool for:
  - Validating policy files against the schema
  - Running policy checks locally
  - Generating human-readable summaries for reviewers

- examples/  
  Ready-to-use policy sets:
  - Treasury limits
  - Multisig thresholds
  - Voting parameters
  - Role-based access control

- specs/  
  Design documents for:
  - Policy model
  - Integration patterns
  - Versioning and migration

Example policy (YAML)

`yaml
version: 1
id: treasury-basic-guardrails
scope: treasury
rules:
  - id: max-single-transfer
    description: Prevent large single transfers without elevated approval.
    type: limit
    params:
      max_amount: 10000
      currency: USDC
      escalation_role: "treasury-committee"
  - id: daily-outflow-cap
    description: Cap total daily outflows from the treasury.
    type: rolling_window
    params:
      window: 24h
      max_outflow: 50000
      currency: USDC
metadata:
  owner: "dao-core"
  tags: ["treasury", "risk", "guardrails"]
`

Use cases

- Define and enforce DAO treasury policies.
- Standardize voting parameters across multiple DAOs.
- Implement role-based access control for program instructions.
- Provide auditors with a clear, machine-readable governance model.

Integration with other projects

- solana-compliance-registry  
  This engine can consume policies and templates published in the registry.

- Solana KYC Compliance SDK  
  Governance policies can reference KYC/compliance requirements as part of access control and role definitions.

Status

- [ ] Define initial POLICY_SCHEMA.json
- [ ] Implement core engine primitives
- [ ] Implement CLI validator
- [ ] Add example policies
- [ ] Publish v0.1.0

# Solana KYC Compliance SDK

### Purpose
A compliance layer designed to bridge institutional KYC/AML processes with Solana’s token infrastructure.

### Key Features
- **On-chain Whitelist Registry:** Secure, transparent, and auditable list of verified addresses.
- **SDK Integration:** Simple TypeScript client for wallet-level verification and token gating.
- **Regulatory Alignment:** Eases the adoption of compliant Real-World Asset issuance.

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Gitdigital-products/solana-kyc-compliance-sdk.git
cd solana-kyc-compliance-sdk

# Build the Rust program
cd programs/compliance_registry
cargo build-bpf

# Build the SDK
cd ../../sdk/typescript
npm install && npm run build
Open-source SDK for enforcing KYC/AML compliance directly at the token level on Solana using Token Extensions (Transfer Hook &amp; Permanent Delegate). Includes a Rust on-chain program, TypeScript SDK, and Compliance Registry for institutional-grade Real-World Asset (RWA) issuance.
